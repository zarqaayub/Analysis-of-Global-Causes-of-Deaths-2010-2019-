# Introduction
According to WHO In 2019, the top 10 causes of death accounted for 55% of the 55.4 million deaths worldwide. The top global causes of death in order of total number of lives lost are associated with three broad topics Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neonatal conditions.
# Data Source
The "causes of death" data set was retrieved from Kaggle. This data set falls under open access under the Creative Commons by license. Published online at Our World in Data.org. https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease
The "Economic Data" was sourced from Kaggle, which is Public and available to anyone to use. https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/legal/terms-of-use-for-datasets
# Data Contents
The two different data sets merged to form the final data set for analysis.
1. The "causes of death" dataset consists of 6120 rows and 33 columns. It contains the deaths caused by country and year.
2. The "Economic Data" consists of 55 columns and 16104 rows. Only the "Country name, country code, Year, GDP per Capita, and Population columns were used in this analysis. 
# Objectives
It's an EDA whose purpose is to provide information about the major reasons behind global deaths. Moreover, it will provide valuable insights for researchers in the future to organize and manage better the resources in Public health to minimize the number of deaths by targeting specifically.
# Goals
1. What are the most common diseases and deadliest causes of death?
2. Is there any trend over the years?
3. Is there a correlation between a country's GDP and causes of death?
4. What are the chances of dying from an external sudden cause versus internal?
5. Do causes of death vary among different countries?
# Data Limitations
There are chances of collection bias or misinformation specifically in low-middle-income countries where they do not have proper death data collection system. For instance, someone may died of old age but been recorded as a sudden external injury. The actual number of deaths may be much higher than the recorded one because the data does not encompass all potential deaths.
